# Black Jack Project

## Motivation
I am creating this project as my first application built in Java. The plan is to build a simple blackjack game using JavaFx.

## Getting Started

This section I will try to keep notes on any libraries installs or walkthroughs neccessary to clone this repo and continue to build this project.

### Basic Requirements or what I used:

- Java SE JDK version 11 or later [go to site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- JavaFx SDK version 11.0.2 or later [go to site](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)
- IntelliJ IDEA (IDE) [go to site](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

### Importing JavaFx

I followed the steps on the docs [JetBrains - javafx](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/javafx.html)

## Process

### Creating initial classes

- First thought is build game without GUI. get the logic built then the GUI.
- I started by creating initial classes and defining a few variables that I know will be needed in a blackjack game. 
- psuedocoded a few methods that will be needed in a blackgame.

### Hard coding values

- hard code values for hand. my thought is get the generally game loop built first then build on that the logic for handling the deck and hands.
