# Black Jack Project

## Motivation
I am creating this project as my first application built in Java. The plan is to build a simple blackjack game using JavaFx.

## Getting Started

This section I will try to keep notes on any libraries installs or walkthroughs neccessary to clone this repo and continue to build this project.

### Basic Requirements or what I used:

- Java SE JDK version 11 or later [go to site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- JavaFx SDK version 11.0.2 or later [go to site](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)
- IntelliJ IDEA (IDE) [go to site](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- VSCode (IDE) [go to site](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Setting up Intellij with JavaFx

I followed the steps on the docs [JetBrains - javafx](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/javafx.html)

### Setting up VSCode with JavaFx

This was actually quite a task to find how to set up (I didn't look at youtube as I like to read)

I originally used a Stack Overflow article that the questions asked was using eclipse and vscode for the same project. [view article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54349894/javafx-11-with-vscode)

I may write a README or Blog for setting up JavaFX in VScode in the future.
